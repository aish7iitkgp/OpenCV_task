# Image Processing with OpenCV

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of OpenCV for advanced image processing, specifically focusing on template matching, image addition, and difference extraction. The goal is to showcase how to identify specific objects within images, combine images for enhanced visualization, and detect changes between images.

## Techniques Used
### PDF to PNG conversion
--**Install pdf2image Package**:

Begin by installing the pdf2image package using a package manager such as pip. This package is essential for converting PDF images to PNG format in Python.
Handle Large Files with pdf2image:

Use the pdf2image package's built-in mechanisms to handle large PDF files efficiently. Consider using parameters like thread_count and dpi to control the conversion process and optimize performance for large-sized PDFs.


**Batch Processing with pdf2image**:

Implement batch processing to handle multiple PDF files in a systematic way. This can be achieved by iterating through a directory of PDF files, converting each one to PNG format using pdf2image functions, and saving the output accordingly. This helps streamline the conversion process for a large number of files.
### Image Addition

- **Objective**: To combine two images, either by overlaying them or adding them to enhance certain features.
- **Approach**: Image addition is performed by calculating the per-element addition of two matrices representing the images.
- **Implementation**: OpenCV's `cv2.add()` function is used for direct addition, where pixel values of two images are added together. This is used for tasks like adding a watermark or combining transparent images.

### Extracting Differences between Images

- **Objective**: To detect changes or differences between two images.
- **Approach**: This involves subtracting one image from another and analyzing the resulting difference image.
- **Implementation**: We utilize OpenCV's `cv2.absdiff()` function to compute the absolute difference between two images, highlighting areas of change or discrepancy.

## Additional Information

- **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed. This project was developed using Python 3.8 and OpenCV 4.5.
- **Run this code to install pdf2image dependencies**:
  
!apt-get update

!apt-get install -y poppler-utils

!pip install pdf2image
- **Dependencies**: Apart from OpenCV, this project may require NumPy for matrix operations and matplotlib for displaying images.
- **Usage**: Each technique is encapsulated in its function, allowing for easy replication and modification for specific needs.

## Conclusion

The project illustrates the power of OpenCV in performing complex image processing tasks efficiently. Through the application of the image addition techniques, and methods for extracting differences between images, we demonstrate a broad range of capabilities in handling and analyzing visual data.
